                        Hi there! I'm Allen, a senior studying cs and math at MIT. In college, I've been involved in
                        HackMIT and Poker Club. I'm interested in the intersection of consumer products, technology, and
                        climate. If you're interested in talking about math, tech or anything really, feel free to
                        contact me.
